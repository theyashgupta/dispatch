# Performance baselines

Measurement-first discipline for Phase 58 (PERF-01..04): no optimization ships without a
before/after number recorded here. The four harnesses below (`scripts/perf-boot.mjs`,
`scripts/perf-subproc.mjs`, `scripts/perf-sse.mjs`, `scripts/perf-rerender.mjs`) each print a
machine-parsable `PERF-<NAME> ...` summary line; every entry in this file quotes that exact line.
If a hot path's numbers show it is already fine, shipping ZERO optimizations for it is a
sanctioned outcome — the harness + numbers are the deliverable either way.

`scripts/perf-rerender.mjs` is reused UNMODIFIED for the PERF-04 React Compiler spike; the spike
MUST run it in the same serve mode recorded below (`prod`) so the with/without comparison is
like-for-like.

Every optimization commit that touches a measured hot path must add an `**After:**` line under
the relevant section, citing the harness command and its output, so a reviewer can diff the
before/after without re-running anything themselves.

## Boot

- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Git SHA measured:** `9a419b7`
- **Machine:** Apple Silicon, local (Node v24.18.0, repo floor >=22.22)
- **Command:** `npm run build && node scripts/perf-boot.mjs --runs=10`
- **Method:** 1 discarded warmup boot (pays one-time seeding: playbook seed, hook-artifact
  install, fresh `board.db` creation) + 10 measured cold starts of the production build
  (`NODE_ENV=production node dist/server/bootstrap/index.js`) against an isolated sandbox `HOME`
  (no `linearApiKey` — poller stays off, deterministic). Timed from spawn to the first `200` on
  `GET /api/board`.

```

```

**After:** _(pending — no boot optimization shipped yet)_

## Subprocess load

- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Git SHA measured:** `9a419b7`
- **Machine:** Apple Silicon, local
- **Commands:**
  - `node scripts/perf-subproc.mjs --window=0` (boot-only profile)
  - `node scripts/perf-subproc.mjs --window=30` (30s steady-state drive window)
- **Method:** production build boots with `DISPATCH_PERF_EXEC=1` (env-gated counter/timer wrapped
  around the sole `run()` exec chokepoint in `src/server/adapters/exec.ts` — NEW-11, execa was
  never installed). `--window=0` SIGTERMs immediately after readiness, capturing only boot-phase
  `run()` calls (preflight binary probes, hook-capability check, editor resolution). `--window=30`
  additionally holds the process open so the 2s marker-watcher tick runs 15x with zero live
  sessions before SIGTERM.

```
boot-only (window=0):
  cmd                  count    total_ms
  claude                   1        53.7
  tmux                     1         6.7
  which                    7        38.1
PERF-SUBPROC window_s=0 calls=9 total_ms=98.4 calls_per_min=0.0

30s steady-state (window=30):
  cmd                  count    total_ms
  claude                   1        48.7
  tmux                     1         4.4
  which                    7        41.5
PERF-SUBPROC window_s=30 calls=9 total_ms=94.6 calls_per_min=18.0
```

**Finding:** the watcher makes ZERO additional `run()` calls across the 30s steady-state window
beyond the 9 calls already made during boot (identical call count in both runs) — with zero live
sessions and `statusChannel: "auto"`, `cardsWithSession()` is empty so the tick's per-session scan
loop never executes. This matches the research's predicted "near-zero steady-state" finding; the
subprocess-load hot path is a legitimate ship-zero-optimizations candidate under this
zero-session-load profile. A future re-measurement with live sessions attached (session-load
`capture-pane` cost) is a separate, not-yet-run scenario.

**After:** _(pending — no subprocess-load optimization shipped yet)_

## SSE fan-out

- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Git SHA measured:** `9a419b7`
- **Machine:** Apple Silicon, local
- **Command:** `node scripts/perf-sse.mjs`
- **Method:** production build boots in a sandbox seeded with ONE real (read-only) Linear sync
  card (only `apiKey`/`filters` lifted from the real `~/.dispatch/config.json`; `board.db` never
  copied). For N in {1, 4, 16}: open N concurrent raw-HTTP readers on `GET /api/stream`, consume
  each client's initial resync frame, fire one local-only `POST /api/cards/:id/move` (`todo` ->
  `done`, never a session-starting move), and time each client's next board `data:` frame arrival
  (named `ping`/`activity` frames excluded). Card restored to `todo` between runs and demoted back
  to `inbox` at teardown.

```
seeded card YAS-44, column=inbox
PERF-SSE n=1 median_ms=3.3 max_ms=3.3
PERF-SSE n=4 median_ms=2.8 max_ms=2.9
PERF-SSE n=16 median_ms=2.8 max_ms=3.0
```

**Finding:** fan-out latency does not scale with client count in this range (1 -> 16 clients:
~2.8-3.3ms flat) — `sse.route.ts` already serializes each snapshot ONCE per broadcast
(`const payload = frame(snapshot)` outside the client `for` loop) before looping `safeWrite` over
the `Set<Response>`, so N-client fan-out is not the bottleneck the naive per-client-serialize
mistake would have created. This hot path is a legitimate ship-zero-optimizations candidate at
this client count.

**After:** _(pending — no SSE optimization shipped yet)_

## Board re-renders

- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Git SHA measured:** `e6adc16`
- **Machine:** Apple Silicon, local (Chrome headless via `--headless=new`)
- **Serve mode:** `prod` — the production build (`NODE_ENV=production node dist/server/
bootstrap/index.js`) registered with the DevTools-hook shim on the FIRST attempt (commits > 0
  after the first interaction), so no `--dev` fallback was needed. **PERF-04's spike must reuse
  this exact `prod` mode** for its with/without comparison to stay like-for-like.
- **Command:** `npm run build && node scripts/perf-rerender.mjs` (run 3 times)
- **Method:** headless Chrome (`--headless=new --remote-debugging-port=9358`, isolated
  `--user-data-dir`) driven via raw CDP over Node's built-in global `WebSocket`/`fetch` (zero new
  npm dependency — the technique proven in 55-02/57-04). A `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`
  shim is injected via `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` BEFORE `Page.navigate`, so it is in
  place before react-dom's module-load-time hook registration; every commit anywhere in the tree
  increments a page-global counter via `onCommitFiberRoot`. A fixed interaction script runs
  against one real (read-only) Linear-synced card in an isolated-HOME sandbox (`apiKey`/`filters`
  lifted from `~/.dispatch/config.json`; `board.db` never copied): (a) view toggle
  Board→Orca→Board, (b) inbox open/close, (c) card select + re-select in Orca/docked mode
  (avoiding the DetailPanel overlay-backdrop trap — 55-02 lesson), (d) one SSE-driven board
  mutation via REST (`todo`→`done`→`todo`) while idle on the board. Interactions are dispatched via
  a real DOM `.click()` (React treats a native `click` Event identically regardless of dispatch
  origin), not synthesized CDP pointer events — sufficient for triggering state transitions/commits,
  unlike 57-04's a11y proof which specifically needed real keyboard events to prove input fidelity.

```
run 1   PERF-RERENDER mode=prod total=20 toggle=6 inbox=4 select=4 sse=6
run 2   PERF-RERENDER mode=prod total=20 toggle=6 inbox=4 select=4 sse=6
run 3   PERF-RERENDER mode=prod total=20 toggle=6 inbox=4 select=4 sse=6

median: PERF-RERENDER mode=prod total=20 toggle=6 inbox=4 select=4 sse=6
```

**Spread note:** three pre-commit dry runs (same harness, uncommitted) showed occasional
`toggle=7`/`total=21` instead of `toggle=6`/`total=20` — traced to `SyncStrip`'s own 1s
`setInterval` tick (unrelated to the interaction script) occasionally landing inside the
350ms toggle settle-window and contributing one extra whole-tree commit, since
`onCommitFiberRoot` fires once per commit for the single React root regardless of which
component scheduled it. The 3 official runs above (recorded at the committed SHA) were
click-for-click identical; this variance is expected and orthogonal to any future
optimization's before/after delta, since both sides of a comparison are subject to the same
clock-tick noise.

**Finding:** 20 commits across the whole fixed interaction script is not obviously excessive for
4 distinct interaction categories touching view-mode swaps, a full-panel mount, and a
`Board`-column re-render on every card move — but there is no prior baseline to compare against,
so no "this number is bad" claim is made here. This is the number any later frontend
optimization task (58-05) and the PERF-04 Compiler spike must cite.

**After:** _(pending — no board re-render optimization shipped yet)_

## Bundle weight

- **Date:** 2026-07-19
- **Git SHA measured:** `b4a6423`
- **Command:** `npm run build:web && node scripts/bundle-budget.mjs`
- **Method:** production `vite build` output under `dist/web`, every file's raw byte count and
  gzip byte count (`node:zlib` `gzipSync`, default level) measured directly by
  `scripts/bundle-budget.mjs`. This is the first measured build for the phase — the script's
  `budgetGzipBytes` thresholds are each this build's measured gzip size **+10% headroom**,
  hardcoded as literals with the measured seed value recorded in a trailing comment beside each
  one (`scripts/bundle-budget.mjs`, `BUDGETS` table). `npm run analyze` (`ANALYZE=1 vite build`)
  produces the visual treemap at `dist/bundle-stats.html` for interactive drill-down; this table
  is the numeric record.

| File                          |  Raw (kB) | Gzip (kB) | Budget gzip (kB, +10%) |
| ----------------------------- | --------: | --------: | ---------------------: |
| `assets/favicon-CVKTVxiB.svg` |       0.5 |       0.3 |                    0.3 |
| `assets/index-DJLXrqcp.js`    |     530.1 |     151.8 |                  167.0 |
| `assets/index-DJYO3imh.css`   |       1.7 |       0.8 |                    0.9 |
| `index.html`                  |       0.6 |       0.4 |                    0.4 |
| **Total**                     | **532.9** | **153.3** |                      — |

```
PERF-BUNDLE files=4 total_raw_kb=532.9 total_gzip_kb=153.3 over_budget=0
```

**Note:** hashed chunk filenames (`index-DJLXrqcp.js`, etc.) change on every rebuild;
`scripts/bundle-budget.mjs` matches by stable prefix+extension pattern (`assets/index-*.js`), not
by exact filename, so this table's filenames are illustrative of the SHA above, not a literal
match requirement for future runs.

**After:** _(pending — no bundle-weight optimization shipped yet)_

## React Compiler decision

_Pending — PERF-04 spike (measured build-time dep cost + board re-render before/after with
`babel-plugin-react-compiler`) not yet run. Adopt/reject decision will be recorded here as a Key
Decision either way._
